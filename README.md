# bird_shooter
Birdshooter game - SDL gaming library

Written in CPP using the SDL gaming library.

Download: SDL2, SDL2_image-2.0.1, SDL2_mixer-2.0.4, SDL2_ttf-2.0.15

After downloading the libraries, place the folders with these exact name in a new folder named 'Dev' inside the root directory of the game files.

Also, if running via Visual Studio, you will need to configure it and add these libraries in the settings. The configuration of Visual studio (x86 or 64) must match the library files you choose.
(Watch a tutorial on installing SDL, if unsure).
